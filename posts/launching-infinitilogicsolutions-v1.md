I'm excited to share the initial release of InfinitiLogicSolutions v1 - a lightweight portfolio and blog built to be fast, simple, and dependable.

This first version focuses on the essentials:

- Clean multi-page experience (Home, About, Projects, Blog, Post)
- PWA install support so it can live on your home screen
- Offline-ready reading once cached
- A simple content pipeline that keeps updates easy

Why this matters: I wanted a space that feels professional but stays minimal - a place to ship projects, share ideas, and keep everything accessible without bloat. Hosting is handled on GitHub Pages, which keeps it free and reliable.

Next up: improving offline cache updates and adding notifications when new projects or posts go live.

If you're building something similar or want to compare notes on PWA and offline-first design, I'd love to connect.

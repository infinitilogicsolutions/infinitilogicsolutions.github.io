## Goal

Build a fast, lightweight portfolio plus blog that is free to host on GitHub Pages, installs as a PWA on mobile, and keeps working offline once cached.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- PWA (Service Worker + Web App Manifest)
- Markdown to JSON content pipeline
- Created using ChatGPT Codex

## Features

- Multi-page layout (Home, About, Projects, Blog, Post)
- Dynamic project/blog listings powered by JSON
- Tag filters and sorting for blog posts
- Installable PWA (add to home screen)
- Offline reading once cached
- Share links and update prompts

## Challenges

- Making offline behavior reliable across pages and sessions
- Balancing cache freshness with fast load times
- Keeping the stack lightweight without a framework

## Future Updates

- In-app notifications when a new project or blog post is published
- Smarter background cache updates
- Optional analytics and performance tuning

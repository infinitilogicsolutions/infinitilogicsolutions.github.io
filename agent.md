# Agent Checklist

- Start a new feature branch for each new mission before merging into `main`.
- Create or update `architectural.md` on every commit with architectural details.
- Update `README.md` with changes.
- Update `releasenotes` if it exists, or create it.
- Ask "What's next?" and update `README.md` with the answer.
- Always write a detailed message about the changes in the commit before pushing into `main`.
- Exception: If the commit only adds or updates a blog post or project entry under `posts/*.md`, you may skip updating `README.md`, `architectural.md`, and `releasenotes`, and you do not need a "What's next?" update.

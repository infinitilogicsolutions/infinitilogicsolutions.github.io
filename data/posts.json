Hosting is handled on GitHub Pages, which keeps it free and reliable.</p>\n<p>Next up: improving offline cache updates and adding notifications when new projects or posts go live.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re building something similar or want to compare notes on PWA and offline-first design, I&#39;d love to connect.</p>\n<p>#PWA #GitHubPages #WebDevelopment #JavaScript #OfflineFirst #Portfolio</p>",

    "contentHtml": "<p>JavaScript has evolved significantly over the years. This guide will help you understand the most important modern features that every developer should know.</p>\n<h2>ES6+ Features</h2>\n<p>Modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) introduced many powerful features that make code more readable and maintainable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arrow Functions:</strong> Concise syntax for writing functions</li>\n<li><strong>Destructuring:</strong> Extract values from arrays and objects easily</li>\n<li><strong>Spread Operator:</strong> Expand arrays and objects</li>\n<li><strong>Template Literals:</strong> String interpolation and multi-line strings</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Async/Await</h2>\n<p>One of the most significant improvements is the async/await syntax, which makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">async function fetchData() {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch(&#39;api/data&#39;);\n    const data = await response.json();\n    return data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Modules</h2>\n<p>ES6 modules allow you to organize code into reusable pieces. You can export functions, objects, or values from one file and import them in another.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Mastering these modern JavaScript features will make you a more effective developer. Start using them in your projects today!</p>",
